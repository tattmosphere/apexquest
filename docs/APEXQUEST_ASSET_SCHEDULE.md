- **Warrior-focused first** since that's your character class
- **Story progression matches gameplay** - assets ready when you need them
- **Each task auto-commits to GitHub** after generation
- **Other classes added later** once warrior path is complete

**Status**: ✅ Week 1 scheduled and ready to execute
