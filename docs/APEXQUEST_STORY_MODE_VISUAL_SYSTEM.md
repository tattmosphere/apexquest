# ApexQuest Story Mode Visual System Design

## Overview

Transform the story mode from text-only to an engaging **comic book-style experience** with illustrated storyboard cards that appear automatically when chapters are completed through workout requirements.

---

## Current Problems

### What Exists Now
- Text-only story display in a dialog
- Manual "Complete Chapter" button (doesn't make sense)
- No visual engagement
- No clear connection between workouts and story progression
- Rewards are just text numbers

### What's Missing
- Visual storytelling through illustrations
- Automatic chapter completion based on workout requirements
- Engaging card-flip/swipe interface
- Dramatic reward reveal system
- Connection between story moments and unlocked content

---

## New Story Mode Flow

### 1. Workout Requirement Tracking

Each chapter has specific workout requirements:

**Chapter 1: "The Bunker"**
- Requirement: Complete 1 workout (any type)
- Tracks in background
- No manual completion needed

**Chapter 2: "First Light"**
- Requirement: Complete 1 workout (any type)
- Auto-unlocks after Chapter 1 complete

**Chapter 3: "The Safe Zone"**
- Requirement: Complete 2 workouts (any type)
- Must be done after Chapter 2

**Chapter 4: "Baptism by Fire"**
- Requirement: Complete 2 strength OR cardio workouts
- Class-specific requirements begin

### 2. Automatic Chapter Completion

When user completes the required workouts:

1. **Background tracking** monitors workout completion
2. **Chapter auto-completes** when requirements met
3. **Storyboard popup immediately appears** (can't be missed)
4. User must view story cards before continuing
5. Can replay story cards later from Story Mode menu

### 3. Comic Book Storyboard Interface

**Card-Based Storytelling System:**

Each chapter consists of 4-6 illustrated cards:

#### Card Types

**Opening Cards (2-3 cards)**
- Dramatic scene-setting illustrations
- Story text overlaid on artwork
- Cinematic transitions between cards
- Swipe/tap to advance

**Choice Card (if applicable)**
- Interactive decision point
- Visual representation of choices
- Buttons for each option
- Shows consequences/rewards for each path

**Climax Card (1 card)**
- Peak dramatic moment
- Action scene or revelation
- Minimal text, maximum visual impact

**Rewards Card (final card)**
- Shows all unlocked content
- Animated reveal of rewards
- Clear visual hierarchy
- Call-to-action to continue

## Technical Implementation

### Database Schema Updates

```sql
-- Track story card viewing
CREATE TABLE story_card_views (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
  user_id UUID REFERENCES auth.users(id),
  chapter_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
  card_index INTEGER NOT NULL,
  viewed_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
  UNIQUE(user_id, chapter_id, card_index)
);

-- Track chapter completion with workout requirements
ALTER TABLE story_progress ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS 
  chapter_workout_progress JSONB DEFAULT '{}';

-- Example structure:
-- {
--   "chapter_1": { "required": 1, "completed": 1, "workout_types": ["any"] },
--   "chapter_4": { "required": 2, "completed": 1, "workout_types": ["strength", "cardio"] }
-- }
```

### Component Structure

```

### Story Content Data Structure

```json
{
  "chapters": [
    {
      "id": 1,

          }
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

### Workout Tracking Integration

```typescript
// In workout logging system
const checkStoryProgress = async (workoutData: Workout) => {
  const { user_id, workout_type } = workoutData;
  
  // Get current story progress
  const { data: progress } = await supabase
    .from('story_progress')
    .select('*')
    .eq('user_id', user_id)
    .single();
  
  const currentChapter = progress.current_chapter;
  const chapterData = storyContent.chapters[currentChapter - 1];
  
  // Check if workout counts toward chapter requirement
  const requirements = chapterData.workout_requirements;
  const workoutProgress = progress.chapter_workout_progress[`chapter_${currentChapter}`] || {
    required: requirements.count,
    completed: 0,
    workout_types: requirements.types
  };
  
  // Check if workout type matches requirements
  if (requirements.types.includes('any') || 
      requirements.types.includes(workout_type)) {
    workoutProgress.completed += 1;
    
    // Update progress
    await supabase
      .from('story_progress')
      .update({
        chapter_workout_progress: {
          ...progress.chapter_workout_progress,
          [`chapter_${currentChapter}`]: workoutProgress
        }
      })
      .eq('user_id', user_id);
    
    // Check if chapter is complete
    if (workoutProgress.completed >= workoutProgress.required) {
      // Trigger storyboard popup
      triggerStoryboardPopup(currentChapter);
      
      // Mark chapter as complete
      await completeChapter(user_id, currentChapter);
    }
  }
};
```

2. **Break into 3-5 card beats**
3. **Identify key visual moments**
4. **Create illustration prompts**
5. **Generate illustrations**
6. **Design card layouts**
7. **Implement in code**
8. **Test flow and animations**

### Illustration Prompt Template

```
Scene: [Chapter X - Scene Name]
Setting: [Environment description]
Characters: [Who's in the scene]
Action: [What's happening]
Mood: [Emotional tone]

- Preload next card while viewing current
- Cache viewed cards

**Animation Performance:**
- Use CSS transforms (GPU accelerated)
- Avoid layout thrashing
- Debounce swipe gestures
- Reduce motion for accessibility

**Data Usage:**
- Download cards on WiFi
- Offline mode for viewed chapters
- Progressive loading
- Compressed assets

---

## Accessibility

**Screen Reader Support:**
- Alt text for all illustrations
- Descriptive card navigation
- Reward announcements

**Visual Accessibility:**
- High contrast text overlays
- Adjustable text size
- Reduced motion option
- Color-blind friendly palette

**Input Methods:**
- Swipe gestures
- Tap to advance
- Keyboard navigation (web)
- Voice control support

---

## Success Metrics

### Engagement Tracking

**Story Completion Rate:**
- % of users who view full storyboard
- Average time spent per card
- Skip rate per card

**Replay Rate:**
- % of users who replay chapters
- Most replayed chapters

**Workout Motivation:**
- Workout completion rate before/after story unlock
- Time to next workout after story completion
